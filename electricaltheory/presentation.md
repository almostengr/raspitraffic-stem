# Electrical Theory

This document will cover some of the basics of electricity and Electrical 
Engineering with the use of a traffic light. To wire up a traffic light, 
requires knowledge of AC and DC circuits, wiring standards, wiring gauge, 
and relays. 

This document is designed to function as a presentation. 

## TOPICS
### High (120 and 240) vs Low (3.3 and 5) Voltage
### AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current)
### Series and Parallel Circuits 
### Relays (Naturally Open and Closed)
### Wire Gauge and Colors

## Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC)

### Alternating Current (AC)

* Eletrons move back and forth (alternate) like liquid shaking in a bottle.
* Has lower losses over longer distances.
* Varies by country and continents

### Direct Current (DC)

* Electrons flow in one direction, like a one way street.
* Has high losses over long distances
* Mostly consistent in other countries and continents

## High Voltage and Low Voltage

### High Voltage Characteristics

* 120 or 240 Volts
* Typically AC
* Normally used in residential and commercial buildings
* Examples: stove, refrigerator
* Can be deadly, regardless of amperage

### Low Voltage Characteristics 

* 3.3, 5, or 12 Volts
* Typically DC
* Normally used in electronics, automobiles, 
* Examples: radios, cars, Raspberry Pi
* If able to use high voltage, has "power brick"
* Generally safe, but Can be deadly at high amperage

### High Voltage Components in Traffic Lights

* Signals
* Relays

### Low Voltage Components in Traffic Lights

* Traffic light controller (Raspberry Pi)
* Sensors
* Relays

### Is it High or Low Voltage? 

* Doorbell
* Cell phone
* Stove
* Computer 
* Ceiling fan
* Lamp
* Television
* Router

## Series and Parallel Circuits

## Series Circuit

* First light is connected to second, second connected to third, etc.
* Example: Christmas Lights 

## Parallel Circuit

* All lights connected to common source
* Example: Brake lights
