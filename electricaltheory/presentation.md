# Electrical Theory

This document will cover some of the basics of electricity and Electrical 
Engineering with the use of a traffic light. To wire up a traffic light, 
requires knowledge of AC and DC circuits, wiring standards, wiring gauge, 
and relays. 

This document is designed to function as a presentation.

## Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC)

### Alternating Current (AC)

* Eletrons move back and forth (alternate) like liquid shaking in a bottle.
* Has lower losses over longer distances.
* Varies by country and continents
* Typically 120, 240, or higher voltage
* Can be deadly, regardless of amperage
* Normally used in residential and commercial buildings
* Examples: stove, refrigerator

### Direct Current (DC)

* Electrons flow in one direction, like a one way street.
* Has high losses over long distances
* Mostly consistent in other countries and continents
* Typically 3.3, 5, or 12 Voltage
* Generally safe, but can be deadly at high amperage
* Examples: cars, Raspberry Pi, electronics

### AC Components in Traffic Light system

* Signals
* Relays

### DC Components in Traffic Light system

* Traffic light controller (Raspberry Pi)
* Sensors
* Relays

### Does it use AC or DC Voltage?

* Doorbell
* Cell phone
* Stove
* Computer 
* Ceiling fan
* Lamp
* Television
* Router

## Series and Parallel Circuits

## Series Circuit

* First light is connected to second, second connected to third, etc.
* Example: Christmas Lights 

## Parallel Circuit

* All lights connected to common source
* Example: Brake lights
